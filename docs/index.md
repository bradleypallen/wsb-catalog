|![health-bulletin-apo-33-a-met-1](thumbnails/health-bulletin-apo-33-a-met-1.jpg)|William S. Burroughs|Health Bulletin: APO-33, A Metabolic Regulator|New York: Fuck You Press, 1965. First. From James Musser's description: "Mimeographed sheets, stapled at the edge. The correct first edition. The legendarily rare Fuck You Press edition of this title published by Ed Sanders who abandoned the project before completion. According to Sanders "maybe as many as ten or twenty" copies were distributed before he halted publication due to Burroughs' dissatisfaction with the copy he'd received. Maynard and Miles state that "a good early copy was secured by Bill Beckman," and that is the copy offered here. Bill Beckman was an artist from Texas who designed album covers for The Fugs, and a good friend of Sanders who regularly gave him copies of current Fuck You Press publications. This copy bears Beckman's ownership signature on the title page. If only 10 or 20 copies did exist originally, far fewer have been accounted for. We know of only 3 copies in private hands, NUC and WORLDCAT turn up no copies in institutions (though there is a copy at Northwestern), and we've never seen a copy offered for sale. The cover sheet has pulled loose from two staples, else fine with all of the illustrations pasted in. Housed in a handsome clamshell box." Schottlaender A13a, Maynard & Miles A12a.|

|![valentine-s-day-reading-1](thumbnails/valentine-s-day-reading-1.jpg)|William S. Burroughs|Valentine's Day Reading|New York: The American Theatre for Poets, 1965. First. Per James Musser: "Program distributed on the occasion of Burroughs' appearance at the East End Theatre in New York, 1965, for a Valentine's Day reading sponsored by The American Theatre for Poets.  Prints "Transcript of Dutch Schultz's Last Words" and "The Coldspring News."  This is Lawrence Ferlinghetti's copy with the notation "Save for CLJ #3" in Ferlinghetti's hand.  Ferlinghetti was apparently going to include this piece in City Lights Journal #3, but decided against it.  Signed by William Burroughs." These are pages 1 through 6, lacking the cover sheet and page 7 ("The Coldspring News"). Schottlaender A16, Maynard & Miles F12.|

|![to-talk-for-joe-the-dead-t-1](thumbnails/to-talk-for-joe-the-dead-t-1.jpg)|William S. Burroughs|"to talk for Joe the Dead" - Typescript|n.p., 1983. Per Brian Cassidy: "[1pp. Typed MSS With Holograph Corrections and Notes From His Short Story 'to talk for Joe the Dead'].  1983.  4to. Very good or better; mild toning along edges where framed mat once was, tape remnant from same to top edge.  Both unobtrusive. Single manuscript page from Burroughs' short story "to talk for Joe the Dead" from his collection TORNADO ALLEY (Cherry Valley, 1989 - provided).  This portion corresponds to pp. 17-18 from that edition.Typed and dated April 16, 1983, the piece likely originated from Burroughs' journal as several lines at the beginning of the page seem to record a dream featuring Allen Ginsberg not mentioned in the published version.  Several hand corrections to typescript as well as two informative notes to upper and lower margins in Burroughs' hand. The first: "He's going to kill his doctor (me)".  The second explains the origins of the story: "This is an extension of Jerry Wallace story about a criminal boy 7 feet tall.  I said, "He'd better abreviate [sic?] himself".  An uncommon look at Burroughs' working methods, even if only in part." |

Per James Musser: "Contains three original b&w photographs of William Burroughs in the Amazon jungle in the 1950s. The photographs were taken by an unknown person who accompanied Burroughs on his South American expedition to research the use of yage by local curanderos, a journey chronicled in The Yage Letters. They show Burroughs in his pith helmet and safari clothes, in one photo wielding a machete, in another posing with a long rifle, and in the third he's standing with two native children. The 5" x 7" photographs are corner-mounted on paper that simulates the bark of the Banisteria caapi vine. The pages are bound into covers of richly textured, sumptuous hand-made paper bound at the spine with brass screws. The booklet was designed and hand-assembled by Johnny Brewton of X-Ray Book Co. in an edition limited to only 26 lettered copies. The photographs, two of which are previously unpublished, were reproduced from the original negatives and are the only prints to be made from these negatives. This first publication from Skyline Books is a nice companion to The Yage Letters, providing an intriguing look at William Burroughs as explorer and ethnobotanist. As new."  Lettered R of 26.
