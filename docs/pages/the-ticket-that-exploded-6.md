## William S. Burroughs. The Ticket That Exploded.

New York: Grove Press, Inc., 1968. Second printing. Inscribed by Burroughs on title page â€œFor Richard Aaron William S. Burroughs." Per Ken Lopez, at one time this was in the collection of Robert and Donna Jackson: "Jackson, a book collector long before he purchased Burroughs' papers, also acquired a number of other copies of Burroughs titles, including ... another group inscribed to Richard Aaron, the bookseller who had helped facilitate the sale of the [Vaduz] archive." Schottlaender A6c, Maynard & Miles A6c.
