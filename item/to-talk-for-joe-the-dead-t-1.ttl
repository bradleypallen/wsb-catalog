            rdf:value "Per Brian Cassidy: \"[1pp. Typed MSS With Holograph Corrections and Notes From His Short Story 'to talk for Joe the Dead'].  1983.  4to. Very good or better; mild toning along edges where framed mat once was, tape remnant from same to top edge.  Both unobtrusive. Single manuscript page from Burroughs' short story \"to talk for Joe the Dead\" from his collection TORNADO ALLEY (Cherry Valley, 1989 - provided).  This portion corresponds to pp. 17-18 from that edition.Typed and dated April 16, 1983, the piece likely originated from Burroughs' journal as several lines at the beginning of the page seem to record a dream featuring Allen Ginsberg not mentioned in the published version.  Several hand corrections to typescript as well as two informative notes to upper and lower margins in Burroughs' hand. The first: \"He's going to kill his doctor (me)\".  The second explains the origins of the story: \"This is an extension of Jerry Wallace story about a criminal boy 7 feet tall.  I said, \"He'd better abreviate [sic?] himself\".  An uncommon look at Burroughs' working methods, even if only in part.\"" ] .
